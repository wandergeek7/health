# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following assets for the app:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

For now, you can use placeholder images or generate them using Expo's asset generation tools.

To generate assets, you can use:
- Expo's asset generator: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/asset-generator
- Or create them manually using design tools

The app will work without these assets, but they're required for production builds.
